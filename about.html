        <h2>What is Connection Pizza?</h2>
        <p>Connection Pizza by Lisa is a tool that helps you visualize and organize your LinkedIn connections in a unique, slice-based way! As an avid LinkedIn user and networking enthusiast, I felt that LinkedIn was missing a feature to easily showcase people within your network who you admire, respect, and value. Really, when you view someone's profile, you might only see a few mutual connections, which usually does not atually capture the value of someone's LinkedIn network. Introducing Connection Pizza (by Lisa). This is a cute little tool that is reminiscent of the MySpace Top 8 friend ranking. This quirky little graphic can be generated in under a minute and shared on the platform to indicate to followers who you value in your network. </p>
